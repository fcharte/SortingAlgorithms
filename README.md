Educational implementation of sorting algorithms 
================================================

Several sorting algorithms implemented in plain C language, with an extensible approach (new algorithms can be connected)
and a simple visualization mechanishm aimed to understand how they work.

The C code is portable to Windows, GNU/Linux and OS X, as the user interface is based on the curses library.

The code is documented (in Spanish) with the doxygen tool http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
